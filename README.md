# Animal Website Generator

The Animal Website Generator is a Python project that creates a dynamic HTML website displaying information about animals.  
Users can enter the name of any animal, and the website fetches details such as diet, type, and location from the API Ninjas Animals API.  
This project is ideal for learners, hobbyists, or anyone interested in exploring animal data in an interactive way.
